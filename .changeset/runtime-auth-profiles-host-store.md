Runtime auth profiles (P1, host store and management API): a coding-CLI runtime can now hold several vendor sign-ins, each in its own credential context on the host. The daemon gains `auth.list` / `auth.create` / `auth.inspect` / `auth.logout` / `auth.operation` RPCs and an `authLogin` mode for `pty.open` (capability `auth-profiles.v1`); a profile's view symlinks sessions, history and config back to the native CLI home so switching auth never forks configuration or transcripts. The API adds `/agent-runtimes/:id/auth-profiles` (list, create, inspect, login, logout, remove), `/agent-runtimes/:id/default-auth` and `/runtime-auth-operations/:id`, with profile metadata, operations and the agent binding columns in new tables. Executing a turn under a profile and the web UI follow in later releases; the existing ambient account probe is unchanged.
