Add a Google Chat channel provider. Connect a Google Chat app to an agent to reach it from direct messages and spaces in Google Workspace: mention gating, one session per thread with replies nested under the message that started them, space and user allowlists with operator rights, inbound file downloads, and native slash commands.

Google signs inbound requests with a JWT rather than an HMAC, so the channel verifies it against Google's key set in either audience mode the Chat API console offers — the endpoint URL (captured for you by Register) or the Cloud project number.

Chat allows only one write per second in each space, shared with every other Chat app there, so this provider defaults its reply mode to Final and paces long replies. Live progress is available per channel. Sending files is not supported: uploading to Chat requires user authorization that an app cannot hold.

`mf channels create --provider` lists the new provider.
