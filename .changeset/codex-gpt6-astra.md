Codex agents can now run GPT-6 Astra. It joins the model catalog at the head of the default preference scan (Astra → GPT-5.6 Sol → Terra → Luna → GPT-5.5 → …), matching the priority order Codex 0.153.4 ships, so a provider that serves Astra now defaults new agents to it while providers without it keep resolving as before. The `max` and `ultra` reasoning levels move from unexposed to selectable, gated per model — Astra, Sol and Terra reach `ultra`, Luna stops at `max`, GPT-5.5 and older stay at `xhigh`. GPT-5.3 Codex is deactivated in the catalog: it no longer exists in the upstream Codex model list.
