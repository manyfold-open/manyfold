The legacy device-code grant flow is removed. `mf login` loses `--poll`, `--wait`, `--scopes`, `--for-agent`, `--limit-to-agent` and `--resume` (and the pending-login file plus its automatic redemption on the next command): `mf auth ensure --scopes <list>` has been the capability-request path since the auth-model refactor, and production minted two grants through the old flow in the last thirty days. On the API, `/auth/cli/start` answers 410 with upgrade guidance when a request carries `requestedScopes`/`requestedAgentId`, `/auth/cli/poll` is a tombstone that always answers the same 410, and the approve/exchange paths refuse the (15-minute-lived) grant sessions a pre-removal deploy may leave behind — so no new `enforceAgentBinding=false` grant can be minted anywhere. Tokens the old flow already issued keep authenticating unchanged; their retirement is the auth-model refactor's Phase 8 and starts its observation window with this release.
