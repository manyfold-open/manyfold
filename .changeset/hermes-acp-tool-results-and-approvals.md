Hermes chat turns now show tool outputs and stop silently denying file edits. The ACP decoder maps terminal `tool_call_update` frames to `tool_result` events (in their own `hermes-acp-x-<n>` ordinal namespace, so a cross-deploy resume cannot re-key rows the old decoder already wrote), and both ACP clients answer `session/request_permission` with an option the request actually offers — the previous hardcoded `approve_for_session` matches no option id current hermes builds advertise, and an unknown id maps to deny on both of hermes's approval bridges, which rejected every file edit on up-to-date hermes images. Billing now also decodes the `cachedReadTokens`/`cachedWriteTokens` spellings the acp 0.9.0 prompt ack uses, so cache tokens stop falling out of usage records. Hermes's streamed `usage_update` ({used} of {size} context-window pressure — not billing) is no longer discarded: the turn's final reading lands on the assistant message and the message-details popover shows a context row.
