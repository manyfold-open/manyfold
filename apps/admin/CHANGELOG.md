### Patch Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/75) [`7ae7ca6`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/7ae7ca63358595e0f2507f22fad9c95d60a9dea2) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Retire the legacy `A2A_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` env fallback: a startup migration moves a still-set value into the `a2a_turn_timeouts` admin setting exactly once (never overwriting an admin's save), clamping it to the setting bounds (30s floor; 1h blocking / 24h async caps — out-of-range values change behavior and are logged), and the resolver now falls back to code defaults instead of the env var when the setting is absent. The API also warns at startup for every legacy `NCA_*`/`WEB_BASE_URL` env alias still set (key names only) and emits a telemetry event when a Lark channel delivers a pre-2.0 legacy-schema message, so both compatibility windows finally have usage signals. The daemon now advertises the `turn.budgets` capability (it has parsed split turn budgets since [#513](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/issues/513)/[#556](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/issues/556) — this makes that queryable), and `MF_CHAT_STREAM_FLUSH_MS` / `MF_TURN_ADOPT_REPOLL_MS` are documented in `.env.example`.

## 0.27.5

### Patch Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/55) [`d01d06b`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/d01d06b3454d99a0a5d156535fc50b0c1c0df400) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Self-hosted accounts created before the deployment set `MF_DEFAULT_PLAN_ID`
  no longer keep cloud `free` limits forever. That variable only ever applied to
  the `users` INSERT, so an account created by an older self-host stack landed
  on `free` and nothing — not upgrades, not migrations, not logging back in —
  ever moved it. The symptom was a quota error naming a plan the operator never
  chose, such as `External API limit reached (3 for Free plan)` when adding a
  fourth Dify / Langflow / A2A agent. On the first start after upgrading, a
  deployment with no billing module and `MF_DEFAULT_PLAN_ID` set to something
  other than `free` moves every remaining `free` account to that plan. It runs
  once, claims its marker in the same transaction as the update, and records the
  move in the audit log — so a later deliberate assignment is never overwritten,
  and a cloud deployment is never touched.

    The admin console gains a **Plan** card on user detail, backed by
    `GET /admin/plans` and `PATCH /admin/users/:id/plan`. Until now the
    open-source composition root had no way to change a user's plan at all, since
    plan changes lived only in the cloud billing module; recovery meant editing
    the database by hand. The route refuses on deployments where billing owns the
    assignment, so a subscription can't be silently desynced from what a user pays
    for.

    `MF_SELFHOST_DEFAULT_PLAN_ID` now overrides the compose stack's default tier
    for new accounts, and self-hosting docs cover how to read and change a user's
    plan.
