### Patch Changes

- [#15](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/15) [`1909ba4`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/1909ba441c54570ff977b1399c9e08d39a2afaf7) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Rename the mf CLI's pre-release update channel from `staging` to `dev`
  throughout. The channel a user selects with `mf update --channel dev` and the
  name the product reports are now the same word.

    - The runtime list labels the channel "Dev" instead of "Staging".
    - `staging` stays accepted as an alias everywhere it can arrive from an older
      peer: the `--channel` flag, a saved `~/.manyfold/update-channel.json`
      preference, the `daemon.update` RPC payload, and version strings — builds
      published before this rename are versioned `x.y.z-staging.<stamp>.<sha>` and
      are still installed in the field, so they keep reading as dev builds.
    - `GET /daemon/cli-versions` gains a `dev` list; the `staging` list is retained
      as a deprecated mirror so an older web bundle keeps working against a newer
      API during a rolling deploy.

    No distribution or update-source behaviour changes here.

- [#19](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/19) [`582285d`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/582285dbbcf8e6168102b4abbba8b886323f2a6b) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The API and web app now point at `https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh` and read
  CLI versions from the release manifests instead of the CDN.

    - The copy-paste install commands in the runtime dialogs, and the install script
      the API runs inside sprites, all use the one installer URL. The channel now
      rides `MF_CHANNEL=dev` rather than a separate staging URL.
    - `GET /daemon/cli-versions` lists stable releases from
      `manyfold-open/manyfold` and reports the dev channel as the single build its
      manifest names — a rolling channel has exactly one installable build by
      definition.
    - Versions below `0.24.0` are filtered out of the stable list: they have no
      per-version manifest, so a pinned upgrade to one could not be resolved by the
      current CLI or installer. Offering it would hand the operator an upgrade that
      fails at download time.
    - The daemon's latest-version probe reads the channel manifest and now also
      reports the target commit, which is what distinguishes two dev builds that
      share a version.

    **Operator-visible:** the API no longer reads `R2_S3_ENDPOINT`,
    `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `R2_PUBLIC_BUCKET` for the CLI
    version catalog — listing dev builds out of an object store is gone. Those
    variables are still used by other features; nothing needs to change to deploy
    this, and they can be retired from the CLI catalog's perspective.

- [#17](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/17) [`a365fa8`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/a365fa8e2a3046e0826a13e22a824e7147508467) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The installer is now manifest-driven and served from `https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh`.

    `install.sh` used to call the GitHub Releases API to find a release, scrape
    `browser_download_url` out of the JSON, and recover the CLI version from the
    asset filename. It now reads the same release manifest `mf update` reads, which:

    - removes the GitHub API dependency and its unauthenticated rate limit — the
      common failure mode was an installer that worked yesterday and 403s today;
    - drops the download from three requests to two, because the checksum travels
      inside the manifest instead of a detached `.sha256` that could be served from
      a different cache generation than the archive it describes;
    - stops depending on `releases/latest`, which is what makes it safe for the CLI
      to leave the edition release train;
    - supports `MF_CHANNEL=dev` for real (`staging` is accepted as the pre-rename
      alias), and `VERSION=` pins either a stable or a dev build.

    The script is also served by the web app at `/cli/install.sh`, so the advertised
    install command becomes:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh | sh -s -- setup
    ```

    It is a committed copy under `apps/web/public/cli/`, kept honest by a
    byte-equality test: neither the OSS nor the cloud web Dockerfile has `apps/cli`
    in scope, so a build-time copy or a symlink would break the image builds.
