### Minor Changes

- [#144](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/144) [`6ee91e5`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/6ee91e5679ad9e22f9f999b0b87663df5586f85a) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Show the signed-in account and its usage on the runtime page, and sign in from there.

    The runtime detail page (`/settings/runtimes/<runtimeId>`) gains an Account section for Claude Code, Codex and Gemini CLI runtimes on self-owned machines and sandboxes: the signed-in identity (email, organization, plan), the sign-in status, and the subscription usage windows with their reset countdowns (Claude 5h/7d, Codex primary/secondary, Gemini per-model quota). The host reads the CLI's own credential files and calls the vendor usage endpoint itself; only the response and non-secret identity fields ever leave the machine.

    - CLI daemon: new `account.inspect` RPC, advertised through the `account.inspect` client feature. Runtime pages of daemons on older CLIs show an update prompt instead of a probe failure.
    - API: `GET /agent-runtimes/:id/account` (`?wake=1` to probe a sleeping sandbox, which starts the VM and reserves an active slot), plus a `runtimeId` target on the terminal websocket for a bare host shell.
    - Web: when the runtime is not signed in, "Sign in" opens an inline terminal on the host that starts the CLI's own headless sign-in (`claude auth login --claudeai`, `codex login --device-auth`, `NO_BROWSER=true gemini`); closing it re-checks the account. The chat sign-in card now recommends `claude auth login --claudeai` too.
    - On macOS machines the Claude and Gemini tokens live in the Keychain, which the daemon deliberately does not read, so identity shows but usage does not.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- [#97](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/97) [`6510fb7`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/6510fb7b1709402ca45062bb37db592d956c6d89) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Hermes chats gain interactive permission approval. The composer's permission menu now works for hermes with three modes mirroring hermes's own edit-approval trio — "Ask for approval", "Accept edits", and "Don't ask" (the default, byte-identical to the previous always-YOLO behavior for every caller that sends no mode). In the ask modes the turn drops `HERMES_YOLO_MODE`, aligns the session via ACP `session/set_mode`, and surfaces `session/request_permission` as an interactive card in the transcript instead of auto-approving; the card's request and settlement persist as stream events AND content blocks, so it survives reconnects and history, and a turn that ends without a resolution renders the card inert. Answers are delivered with `POST …/messages/:messageId/permissions/:requestId` and routed like cancel: the in-process coordinator first, the carrying daemon via the new `turn.permission` RPC second, and a durable `chat_permission_answers` row plus pg NOTIFY for a peer-owned interactive turn (the composite PK makes the second answer a 409 — first click wins). An unanswered ask denies after `HERMES_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5 min) with the request's own reject option, and pending asks tick the turn's inactivity budget so a human deciding never reads as a hang. Ask modes on a daemon without the new `turn.hermes.permissions` capability are refused with `hermes_daemon_permissions_upgrade_required` — never silently downgraded to YOLO. The daemon publishes a synthetic `_manyfold/permission_resolution` line into the exec buffer before the child's reply, so a replayed stream reproduces the settlement in live order.

- [#98](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/98) [`5701b2f`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/5701b2fa489aefb84350e2eb9ba7162849fc7218) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Hermes chats can switch models per message. The composer's model menu now works for hermes agents (options come from the agent's provider-models cache, which the model-config view serves for hermes too, with a filter box once the list grows past a screenful), and the choice is applied via ACP `session/set_model` — hermes persists a session's model in its own state.db, so env vars cannot move a resumed session. Every transport reconciles by diffing against the models state hermes reports on session/new|resume: an untouched session costs no RPC, and picking "Default" re-sends the default's id because a hermes session would otherwise keep the previous pick under a UI that claims otherwise. Daemon-carried turns gate on the new `turn.hermes.options` capability: an explicit switch on an older daemon is refused with `hermes_daemon_options_upgrade_required` (never silently dropped), while the auto-defaulted value skips quietly; a hermes build that predates `session/set_model` fails an explicit switch as `hermes_set_model_unsupported`. The daemon reports the session's models/modes state on the turn final, captured best-effort into `agents.extras.hermesAcp` for diagnostics.

### Patch Changes

- [#95](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/95) [`bec1b35`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/bec1b356edf0467c51632946050a1a8858245a6b) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Hermes chat turns now show tool outputs and stop silently denying file edits. The ACP decoder maps terminal `tool_call_update` frames to `tool_result` events (in their own `hermes-acp-x-<n>` ordinal namespace, so a cross-deploy resume cannot re-key rows the old decoder already wrote), and both ACP clients answer `session/request_permission` with an option the request actually offers — the previous hardcoded `approve_for_session` matches no option id current hermes builds advertise, and an unknown id maps to deny on both of hermes's approval bridges, which rejected every file edit on up-to-date hermes images. Billing now also decodes the `cachedReadTokens`/`cachedWriteTokens` spellings the acp 0.9.0 prompt ack uses, so cache tokens stop falling out of usage records. Hermes's streamed `usage_update` ({used} of {size} context-window pressure — not billing) is no longer discarded: the turn's final reading lands on the assistant message and the message-details popover shows a context row.

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/81) [`1e5d661`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/1e5d661d7adc4a06e984e742f965a81e70c841bf) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The daemon's hello and heartbeat now advertise `model.credential-facts`, a retroactive capability flag for the credentialFacts field its model.inspect responses already carry. No behavior change — the flag makes fleet coverage queryable from `runtime_hosts.client_features`.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- [#76](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/76) [`113e790`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/113e790cf05bd7195dfbcad3c86a328274355229) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - `mf skills discover` is paginated: it now requests the paged discovery endpoint, gains `--sort featured|latest`, `--cursor` and `--limit` (default 100, the server max), prints a next-page hint on stderr when more results exist, and `--json` output changes shape from a bare array to the page object `{items, nextCursor}` (before: `[…summaries]`; after: `{"items":[…summaries],"nextCursor":"100"|null}` — scripts reading the JSON should switch to `.items`). The discover API route additionally emits a shape-usage telemetry event so the legacy bare-array branch has a measurable removal gate. Human-readable ordering follows the catalog's featured ranking instead of the legacy unranked order.

### Patch Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/75) [`7ae7ca6`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/7ae7ca63358595e0f2507f22fad9c95d60a9dea2) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Retire the legacy `A2A_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` env fallback: a startup migration moves a still-set value into the `a2a_turn_timeouts` admin setting exactly once (never overwriting an admin's save), clamping it to the setting bounds (30s floor; 1h blocking / 24h async caps — out-of-range values change behavior and are logged), and the resolver now falls back to code defaults instead of the env var when the setting is absent. The API also warns at startup for every legacy `NCA_*`/`WEB_BASE_URL` env alias still set (key names only) and emits a telemetry event when a Lark channel delivers a pre-2.0 legacy-schema message, so both compatibility windows finally have usage signals. The daemon now advertises the `turn.budgets` capability (it has parsed split turn budgets since [#513](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/issues/513)/[#556](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/issues/556) — this makes that queryable), and `MF_CHAT_STREAM_FLUSH_MS` / `MF_TURN_ADOPT_REPOLL_MS` are documented in `.env.example`.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- [#69](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/69) [`0f66aec`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/0f66aec076e7d5e6c4c070577e9e0653c9839278) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The legacy device-code grant flow is removed. `mf login` loses `--poll`, `--wait`, `--scopes`, `--for-agent`, `--limit-to-agent` and `--resume` (and the pending-login file plus its automatic redemption on the next command): `mf auth ensure --scopes <list>` has been the capability-request path since the auth-model refactor, and production minted two grants through the old flow in the last thirty days. On the API, `/auth/cli/start` answers 410 with upgrade guidance when a request carries `requestedScopes`/`requestedAgentId`, `/auth/cli/poll` is a tombstone that always answers the same 410, and the approve/exchange paths refuse the (15-minute-lived) grant sessions a pre-removal deploy may leave behind — so no new `enforceAgentBinding=false` grant can be minted anywhere. Tokens the old flow already issued keep authenticating unchanged; their retirement is the auth-model refactor's Phase 8 and starts its observation window with this release.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/54) [`f5b6347`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/f5b634742aa4bf76ebea6df73c7f52a6fcd8c311) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Local config is now checked before it is trusted, and you can pick a model from
  it.

    The "Local config" model source used to treat the presence of a config
    directory as proof of a working login. Claude Code needed only `~/.claude` to
    exist; Codex accepted an `auth.json` it could not even parse; Gemini read
    `oauth_creds.json` without ever looking at the `expiry_date` inside it. On top
    of that the source skipped model validation entirely, so a signed-out machine
    advertised itself as ready and the failure only surfaced when a message was
    already on its way.

    Both inspect paths now report what they actually found — whether a token is
    present, when it expires, whether a refresh token can renew it, which
    third-party gateways `~/.codex/config.toml` configures — and the verdict is
    computed from those facts. Because the facts carry timestamps rather than a
    yes/no, a snapshot taken an hour ago stops claiming a live token without
    needing to be re-inspected. A sign-in that has expired with no way to renew is
    now reported in the composer and refused at send time; the refusal re-inspects
    the runtime first, so signing in again on that machine is enough to clear it.

    Two situations deliberately stay permissive. A daemon older than this change
    reports no facts, and a macOS host keeps its Claude token in the keychain,
    which a background daemon must not prompt for — neither can be judged, so
    both keep working exactly as before.

    Picking a model under "Local config" works now. The models your CLI reported
    are listed in the composer, alongside Claude's effort and Codex's speed and
    reasoning level, each with a "CLI default" entry that hands the decision back
    to the local CLI. Nothing is filled in on your behalf: a knob you never set
    sends no flag at all. `/model` in a channel and `mf model-config update
--model` set the model too — until now they reported success and silently
    discarded it.

    The concrete model id you pick is passed through as-is. The hosted path maps a
    version onto its family alias (`claude-sonnet-4-5` became `--model sonnet`)
    because it repoints that alias through the environment; a local CLI has no
    such indirection, so an agent whose stored model was a full id now runs that
    exact version.

    Also fixes the sandbox copy of the inspector, where an over-escaped pattern
    made `requires_openai_auth = true` unmatchable, letting a hosted runtime treat
    `OPENAI_API_KEY` as usable even when the local config required a ChatGPT
    sign-in.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/17) [`a365fa8`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/a365fa8e2a3046e0826a13e22a824e7147508467) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The installer is now manifest-driven and served from `https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh`.

    `install.sh` used to call the GitHub Releases API to find a release, scrape
    `browser_download_url` out of the JSON, and recover the CLI version from the
    asset filename. It now reads the same release manifest `mf update` reads, which:

    - removes the GitHub API dependency and its unauthenticated rate limit — the
      common failure mode was an installer that worked yesterday and 403s today;
    - drops the download from three requests to two, because the checksum travels
      inside the manifest instead of a detached `.sha256` that could be served from
      a different cache generation than the archive it describes;
    - stops depending on `releases/latest`, which is what makes it safe for the CLI
      to leave the edition release train;
    - supports `MF_CHANNEL=dev` for real (`staging` is accepted as the pre-rename
      alias), and `VERSION=` pins either a stable or a dev build.

    The script is also served by the web app at `/cli/install.sh`, so the advertised
    install command becomes:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh | sh -s -- setup
    ```

    It is a committed copy under `apps/web/public/cli/`, kept honest by a
    byte-equality test: neither the OSS nor the cloud web Dockerfile has `apps/cli`
    in scope, so a build-time copy or a symlink would break the image builds.

- [#20](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/20) [`c738de9`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/c738de9aa8e21810070569ae35c752cdb0aa6bf1) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - `mf update` now resolves releases through a JSON manifest instead of a plaintext
  `latest/version.txt` plus a derived download path.

    The old protocol asked the CDN for a version string, then built the asset URL
    and a sibling `.sha256` URL by string concatenation. That meant three requests
    where the checksum could be served from a different cache generation than the
    bytes it described, and it hard-coded the storage layout into every installed
    binary — so the artifacts could never move.

    A channel now points at one manifest, and the manifest names every artifact by
    absolute URL with its sha256:

    - `https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/releases/download/cli-channels/{stable,dev}.json`
      for the channel head, and a per-release `manifest.json` so `mf update --to`
      and the daemon's remote upgrade can still reach an arbitrary past build.
    - Two round trips instead of three, and the checksum can no longer disagree
      with the archive it covers.
    - The binary derives no URLs, so a future storage move needs a new manifest,
      not a new release of the CLI.

    **The dev channel is ordered by commit, not semver.** Consecutive dev builds
    share a base version, so the comparator reported them equal forever. Builds now
    carry their source commit and build time, and `mf version --verbose` / `--json`
    report them — the dev channel sees an update when the commit moves even though
    `x.y.z` has not.

    **The dev channel is an update policy, not an environment.** It no longer
    carries its own API endpoint: both channels default to the production API, and a
    pre-production endpoint is selected per profile with an explicit `--api-url` at
    login. `mf update --channel dev` says so when it switches.

    Also in this change:

    - New `mf version` command: bare output is byte-identical to `mf --version`,
      with `--verbose` and `--json` adding channel, commit, build time, target,
      install method and paths.
    - The daemon's background auto-updater follows the **saved** update channel.
      It previously used the baked one, so a machine where someone ran
      `mf update --channel dev` kept auto-updating along stable, silently undoing
      the choice on the next tick.
    - `mf update` and the API share one version comparator (`compareCliSemver`)
      instead of keeping a second, prerelease-blind copy in the CLI.
    - The `daemon.update` RPC reports which commit it landed on.

    Channel switching stays on `mf update --channel <dev|stable>`; no `mf channel`
    command was added, because `mf channels` already manages messaging channels and
    the singular/plural pair would be a permanent trap.

### Patch Changes

- [#15](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/15) [`1909ba4`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/1909ba441c54570ff977b1399c9e08d39a2afaf7) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - Rename the mf CLI's pre-release update channel from `staging` to `dev`
  throughout. The channel a user selects with `mf update --channel dev` and the
  name the product reports are now the same word.

    - The runtime list labels the channel "Dev" instead of "Staging".
    - `staging` stays accepted as an alias everywhere it can arrive from an older
      peer: the `--channel` flag, a saved `~/.manyfold/update-channel.json`
      preference, the `daemon.update` RPC payload, and version strings — builds
      published before this rename are versioned `x.y.z-staging.<stamp>.<sha>` and
      are still installed in the field, so they keep reading as dev builds.
    - `GET /daemon/cli-versions` gains a `dev` list; the `staging` list is retained
      as a deprecated mirror so an older web bundle keeps working against a newer
      API during a rolling deploy.

    No distribution or update-source behaviour changes here.

- [#18](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/pull/18) [`d454437`](https://github.com/manyfold-open/manyfold/commit/d4544372f03391943400bf874f87c9bcbaac386b) Thanks [@yingca1](https://github.com/yingca1)! - The CLI now builds and publishes from this repository, on its own release train.

    Two channels, two triggers:

    - **stable** — a `cli-v<version>` tag. `release-cli` builds the five targets,
      creates the `cli-v<version>` release, then promotes that release's manifest to
      `stable.json`.
    - **dev** — every `develop` commit whose `ci` run passed. `release-cli-dev`
      builds the same five targets, attaches them to the rolling `cli-dev`
      prerelease, then rewrites `dev.json`.

    Both write the channel pointer last, so a reader never sees a manifest naming an
    artifact that is still uploading. The pointers live on a fixed `cli-channels`
    prerelease, which keeps their URLs stable forever.

    The dev channel is gated on CI completion rather than on push, because it has
    to mean "latest successful develop build" — a red build must never become the
    thing every dev machine installs.

    `ci` now also runs on `develop` pushes, and a `sync-release-to-develop`
    workflow back-merges `main` after a version PR; without it `changeset version`
    would delete consumed changesets on `main` only and the next promotion would
    resurrect them.

Notes before 0.23.3 predate this repository's public history; they live on
the docs site's changelog pages.

## 0.23.3

### Patch Changes

- `mf daemon register` now resolves its API endpoint the same way every other command does: an explicit root `--api-url` wins, then the profile's stored `apiUrl` from `mf login`, then the channel default. Previously the stored profile endpoint was skipped, so a machine logged into a self-hosted API silently tried to enrol against the default endpoint and was told its daemon token did not exist.
